      <h1>Catherine's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Yu-Chi Chen. I am currently a junior at 
          <a href= "https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University of New York.</a></p>
      <img src="images/IMG_0514 2.JPG" width="400" height="300"/>
      <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Fun Fact: Columbia's school colour, Patone 290, 
          is one of my favourite colours as well. (btw, this colour is not Pantone 290 lol)</p>
      
      <h2>About Me: Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 2000. Along with my mother, and sister, I immigrated to 
          Toronto, Canada in 2010, while my father stayed in Taiwan to work and support our family.</p>
      <p>I studied in Canada from grade 5 to 12, and I attended high school at 
          <a href= "https://earlhaig.ca/main.php">Earl Haig Secondary School</a>, where I was part of the 
          <a href="https://earlhaig.ca/departments/claude/site/index.php">Claude Watson Arts Program</a>
           as a music major specializing in the cello.</p>

      <h3>My Music Experience</h3>
      <p>I began my musical journey by playing piano in kindergarden.</p> 
      <img src="images/Chen_Catherine.jpg" width="200" height="225"/>
      <p>Afterwards, my elementary school required that the students participate in some sort of 
          extra-curriculum activity, and I experimented with many things. Ultimately, I began playing 
          the cello seriously when I was 10 years old and continued until I was a sophomore in high school.
           During my junior and senior years of high school, I focused more on chamber and orchestral music, 
           as well as composition</p>

    <p>This was filmed quite a while back and quite hastily, so my playing isn't the best haha.</p>

      <p>I enjoy an array of mediums for visual arts, from sketching, to painting, calligraphy, sewing, 
          woodwork, sculpting, and photoshop.</p>
      <p>I have never undergone professional training in art, but I like doing it in my spare time.</p>

      <p>I have been swimming since I was in kindergarden, and I was on the swim team in high school. </p>
    
      <h4>Dogs</h4>
      <p>I have two dogs: Minnie the Mini Pinscher, and LuLu the Doberman. Unfortunately, 
          Minnie passed away last spring.</p>

      <h2>About Me: Where Am I Now? Data Science</h2>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, I am a junior at Columbia University. 
          I am currently majoring in Data Science, which
          is a special joint-major that is offered by the statistics 
          and computer science department at Columbia,
          that was created in response to the growing significance of "big data".

              computer vision, machine learning, and AI, to perform spinal surgeries. At Point Robotics,
              I developed a program for 3D image reconstruction, GUI development for the program, and 
              implemented the program to perform 3D printing of the reconstructed models. In addition,
              I conducted research on various computer vision techniques in order to improve image reconstruction,
              as well as other recognition technologies required for the surgical robots.
