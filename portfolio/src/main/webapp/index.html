      <h1>Catherine's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Yu-Chi Chen. I am currently a junior at 
          <a href= "https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University of New York.</a></p>
      <img src="images/IMG_0514 2.JPG" width="400" height="300"/>
      <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Fun Fact: Columbia's school colour, Patone 290, 
          is one of my favourite colours as well. (btw, this colour is not Pantone 290 lol)</p>
      
      <h2>About Me: Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 2000. Along with my mother, and sister, I immigrated to 
          Toronto, Canada in 2010, while my father stayed in Taiwan to work and support our family.</p>
      <p>I studied in Canada from grade 5 to 12, and I attended high school at 
          <a href= "https://earlhaig.ca/main.php">Earl Haig Secondary School</a>, where I was part of the 
          <a href="https://earlhaig.ca/departments/claude/site/index.php">Claude Watson Arts Program</a>
           as a music major specializing in the cello.</p>

      <h3>My Music Experience</h3>
      <p>I began my musical journey by playing piano in kindergarden.</p> 
      <img src="images/Chen_Catherine.jpg" width="200" height="225"/>
      <p>Afterwards, my elementary school required that the students participate in some sort of 
          extra-curriculum activity, and I experimented with many things. Ultimately, I began playing 
          the cello seriously when I was 10 years old and continued until I was a sophomore in high school.
           During my junior and senior years of high school, I focused more on chamber and orchestral music, 
           as well as composition</p>

      <h4>Visual Art</h4>
      <img src="images/IMG_0074.JPG" width="475" height="300"/>
      <p>I enjoy an array of mediums for visual arts, from sketching, to painting, calligraphy, sewing, 
          woodwork, sculpting, and photoshop.</p>
      <p>I have never undergone professional training in art, but I like doing it in my spare time.</p>

      <h4>Swimming</h4>
      <p>I have been swimming since I was in kindergarden, and I was on the swim team in high school. </p>
    
      <h4>Dogs</h4>
      <p>I have two dogs: Minnie the Mini Pinscher, and LuLu the Doberman. Unfortunately, 
          Minnie passed away last spring.</p>

      <h2>About Me: Where Am I Now? Data Science</h2>
        <p>In my senior year of high school, I took a course called Data Management, which included
            topics that covered probability theory, and basic regressions/analysis. For my cumulative 
            project in that class, I conducted research on the relationship between a country's
            GDP per capita, and cereal consumption per capita - which I was interested in after 
            reading the book 'Guns, Germs, and Steel'. As the book outlines, there appears to be a
            positive correlation between the two variables:

        <p>Upon taking this course, I became enticed by the field of data science. However, I was still new 
            to the area, and so during my first and second year of college, I experimented with
            different subjects - math, chemistry, computer science, etc. However, my passion for data persisted
            and I ultimately declared as a Data Science major this spring. Data Science
            is a special joint-major that is offered by the statistics 
            and computer science department at Columbia 
            that was created in response to the growing significance of "big data".

      <h3>Working Experiences</h3>
      <p>Below is a list of some of my past/current working experiences:</p>

          <dd>ITRI is a leading research and development institution in Taiwan that 
              works towards transforming Taiwan's technology industry. At ITRI, I worked in the 
              biomaterials lab, where I assisted in conducting experiments for biomaterial development,
              and conducted research on the innovation of various biomaterials.</dd>
          <p><p>
          <dt><b>Intern at Point Robotics MedTech Inc. Intern</b></dt>
          <p><p>

          <dd>Point Robotics is a relatively new company that develops surgical robots relying on
              computer vision, machine learning, and AI, to perform spinal surgeries. At Point Robotics,
              I developed a program for 3D image reconstruction, GUI development for the program, and 
              implemented the program to perform 3D printing of the reconstructed models. In addition,
              I conducted research on various computer vision techniques in order to improve image reconstruction,
              as well as other recognition technologies required for the surgical robots.
